Unfortunately, Luminous Arc 3 was never officially localized for English-speaking audiences. However, thanks to a dedicated fan translation team, you can now enjoy this game in English with a patch that covers the entire game, including the online mode. In this article, we will show you how to apply the patch and play Luminous Arc 3 in English on your PC or DS.
 
## What You Need
 
- A copy of the original Japanese ROM of Luminous Arc 3. You can find it online or dump it from your own cartridge using a DS flashcart. The CRC-32 of the original ROM should be 848822fd.
- The Luminous Arc 3 English patch v.1.0. You can download it from [this GBAtemp thread](https://gbatemp.net/threads/release-luminous-arc-3-english-patch.605026/) [^1^] or [this GameBrew page](https://www.gamebrew.org/wiki/Luminous_Arc_3_English_Patch) [^2^]. The patch is in xDelta format and has a size of 1.4 MB.
- A tool for applying xDelta patches. You can use xdelta UI, Delta Patcher, or MultiPatch. You can download them from [this RomHacking page](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/704/) [^1^].
- A DS emulator or a DS flashcart to play the patched ROM. We recommend using DeSmuME or melonDS for PC emulation, or R4i Gold 3DS Plus or DSTWO Plus for DS flashcarts.
- If you want to play online mode, you will need to configure your emulator or flashcart with Wiimmfi Network. You can follow [this guide](https://luminousarc.fandom.com/wiki/Multiplayer) on how to do that.

## How to Apply the Patch

1. Extract the Luminous Arc 3 English patch v.1.0.zip file to a folder on your PC.
2. Open your xDelta patching tool and select the original Japanese ROM as the source file and the Luminous Arc 3 English patch v.1.0.xdelta as the patch file.
3. Choose a name and location for the output file. This will be your patched ROM.
4. Click on Apply Patch and wait for the process to finish.
5. Verify that the CRC-32 of the patched ROM is caec12b5. If not, try patching again with a different tool or a different ROM.

## How to Play the Game
 
Once you have your patched ROM, you can play it on your PC using a DS emulator or on your DS using a flashcart. Just load the ROM as you would normally do and enjoy Luminous Arc 3 in English.
 
If you want to play online mode, make sure you have configured your emulator or flashcart with Wiimmfi Network first. Then, select Online Mode from the main menu and follow the instructions on screen. You can join or create rooms with other players who have the same patch and play co-op or versus battles.
